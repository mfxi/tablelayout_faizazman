This subject are make me to learn how to do coding and make a website. So it is a new experience for me to do this thing. It is because i used to learned a graphic design back then. It is a different things to me because use a different sotware and different skills. Besides, this coding are focus on computer languages to tell computers and programs it. With zero knowledge about this things i have to explore many things in the coding world to get a good design and proficient in coding. Same like other either graphic design or coding it also related when it come to design.</p>
